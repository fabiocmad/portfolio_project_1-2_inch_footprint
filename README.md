# 2-Inch Footprint
Welcome! https://fabiocmad.github.io/portfolio_project_1-2_inch_footprint/

# *HTML/CSS static website for photography enthusiasts.*

Out of the love for photography and the extra time spent at home during Covid times, the idea for 2-Inch Footprint came to live. By adding her own perspective and eye for details, the photographer from the account @2inchfootprint decided to change the way we see the world, adding characters to day to day landscapes.

This site will help people to open their eyes to new ideas and a whole new world that sometimes pass by us in the rush of our daily routine. The site will be usefull to photographers that might want to connect and share their own perspective and worlds trought their own lens, by building a community.

**A live version on the website can be found** [here](https://fabiocmad.github.io/portfolio_project_1-2_inch_footprint)
