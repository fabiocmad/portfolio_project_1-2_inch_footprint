# 2-Inch Footprint
Welcome! https://fabiocmad.github.io/portfolio_project_1-2_inch_footprint/

# *HTML/CSS static website for photography enthusiasts.*

Out of the love for photography and the extra time spent at home during Covid times, the idea for 2-Inch Footprint came to live. By adding her own perspective and eye for details, the photographer from the account @2inchfootprint decided to change the way we see the world, adding characters to day to day landscapes.

This site will help people to open their eyes to new ideas and a whole new world that sometimes pass by us in the rush of our daily routine. The site will be usefull to photographers that might want to connect and share their own perspective and worlds trought their own lens, by building a community.

**A live version on the website can be found** [here](https://fabiocmad.github.io/portfolio_project_1-2_inch_footprint)

# Features
The website color pallete was carefully choosen. Peach/Orange color is excellent for communication, influences good manners and calms down. Which is the purpose of the website. To gather people with interest on photography, keen on exercising and Instagram walks, to build a sense of community that was highly affected during there Pandemic times.

## Existing Features
### The Navigation Bar
The nav bar is included on all three pages. It had a 2-Inch Logo on the left hand side, and to the right hand side it has a Home, Gallery and SignUp options for navigation between the pages. This section is handy not only to allow user to navigate between pages, but also to pass the confidence on UX by having a structured familiar regarless of the page the user is navigating.

### The Instagram Walk Times
In this section users can see the dates, times and location for three weekly meetings times if they want to signup and participate. As meeting are always at the same times of the week, no changes to this section will need to be made further ahead.

The Times Section (and all the rest of the website too) was designed to attract and give the best user experience possible, so for smaller screens, a responsive design will take effect and the layout for this section will change to fit the device.

## Wireframe
### Home Page
First idea behind the home page. I decided to change the layout of the copyrights for better balance of elements on the page.

### Gallery Page
Was able to achieve the first idea on the wireframe. I am not happy with the fact that pictures are not aligned on the bottom. Due to time limit, I would continue working on the layout of the gallery to theres no gaps between images and the bottom between them is aligned.

### Sign Up Page
I was able to keep layout close to the original idea. Decided to move the signup form to the left as the image on desktop complements the position of the form.

## Unfixed Bugs
While the layout of the gallery reached the expected result, I would like to change the bottom of the page to make sure all images are aligned and responsive, without getting pixelated or loosing focus. I intend to tackle this in the future to avoid this behaviour as I believe website will be more elegant and pleasant for the user.
